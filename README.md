Genesis is a research-driven project focused on robotic object reconstruction using dexterous manipulation. The system employs dual robotic arms to analyze, grasp, and reconstruct objects in a structured environment. This project explores motion planning techniques to enable intelligent robotic interactions between the involved subjects.
